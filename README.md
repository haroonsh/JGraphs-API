# JGraphs-API
An in-progress Graph Theory API being developed in Java.

It will contain multiple different graph types (weighted, directed, complete, bipartite)
and will eventually support different graph algorithms such as Bellman-Ford's single source shortest path.
At the end, I hope to implement an abstract factory method design pattern to put all the graphs behind
an interface.
